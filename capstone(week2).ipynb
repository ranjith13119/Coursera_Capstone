The statistics relate only to personal injury accidents on public roads that are reported to the police, and subsequently recorded, using the STATS19 accident reporting form.\n",

    "There has been an increasing demand for more up to date information on reported road accidents to be made available to the public, stakeholders and researchers. As a result, the Department for Transport made a dataset covering accidents for the first and second quarters of 2018 in Great Britain available for the first time on data.gov.uk. The data released was an un-validated subset and has been superseded by the full accident dataset for 2018, released after validation for the full year."
